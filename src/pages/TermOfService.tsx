            <p>You agree to input your <span className="font-semibold">*real, actual, final grades*</span>. Inputting a fake grade is a violation of this contract and the natural order. The punishment is not a ban. The punishment is the silent, eternal judgment of your peers and my disappointment in you, then execution (your account or you whatever).</p>
            <p>You agree not to attempt to <span className="font-semibold">exploit, hack, or reverse-engineer</span> the platform.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">7. Intellectual Property</h2>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">8. Our Liability</h2>
            <p>Let's be clear. This is a final grade calculator. If the website spontaneously combusts, takes your grade with it, and causes you to have a minor emotional breakdown, that's on you. We are not liable for:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Inaccurate calculations (did <span className="font-semibold">you</span> put in the right numbers?)</li>
              <li>Existential crises triggered by seeing your classmate at the top of the leaderboard</li>
              <li>Any third-party actions (e.g., GitHub issues affecting login)</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">9. The Fine Print</h2>
            <p>By clicking "Login", you hereby:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
              <li>Grant me perpetual, irrevocable rights to use your grade data to create sick graphs and charts for my portfolio</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">10. Termination</h2>
            <p>I can terminate your access at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. Maybe I don't like your email address. Maybe your grades are too good and you're making the rest of us look bad. It's a vibe check, and I'm the only one who gets to administer it.</p>
