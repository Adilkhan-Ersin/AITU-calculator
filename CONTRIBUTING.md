# ü§ù Contributing to AITU Grade Calculator

Thank you for considering contributing to the AITU Grade Calculator! This open-source project thrives on community feedback and contributions. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new university grading rules, or suggesting a new feature, your help is welcome.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is governed by our **Code of Conduct**. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How to Contribute

We encourage contributions through **GitHub Pull Requests (PRs)**. The general workflow is as follows:

### 1. Get Set Up

* **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
* **Clone** the forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/)[PROJECT_NAME].git
    ```
* **Create a new branch** for your work. Use a descriptive name like `feature/add-gpa-support` or `fix/rounding-error`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-descriptive-branch-name
    ```

### 2. Make Your Changes

* Make your changes, fixes, or additions to the code.
* **Keep your code clean and well-commented.** This is especially important for complex grading logic!
* If you're adding a new feature, consider how it will be used and how it affects existing functionality.

### 3. Test Your Changes

* Ensure that all existing features of the calculator still work after your changes.
* If you introduced new functionality, please include **tests** (if the project has a test suite) or manually verify the calculations are correct.

### 4. Commit and Push
